    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) data will be used to create interesting analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, assessing and cleaning will be performed for great analyses and visualizations. The steps followed in this project are as follows:\n",
    "Your tasks in this project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Assessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Storing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, three pieces of data was gathered. 'The WeRateDogs Twitter archive' as twitter_archive_enhanced.csv, 'The tweet image predictions' as image_predictions.tsv, and 'The Additional data from the Twitter API' as a tweet_json.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: Assessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 data gathered, was assessed visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. We Detected and documented at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of assessment was performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Visual assessment`: Each piece of gathered data was displayed in the Jupyter Notebook for visual assessment purposes. Once displayed, data is then additionally assessed in an external application (e.g. Excel, text editor).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Programmatic assessment`: Pandas' functions and/or methods was used to assess the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Detected and documented Issues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Issues \n",
    "\n",
    "**The twitter Archive WeRateDogs data table**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. missing data **in_reply_to_status_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, and expanded_urls**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. irregular urls format in the **source** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ambiguous values in the **rating denominator** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ambiguous values in the **rating numerator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. wrong datatype of **tweet_id**. should be string and not Integer as displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. incorrect dog names in the **name** column i.e (None, a, an, â€¦)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. the datatype of **timestamp** as object is not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Image predictions data table** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the **p1, p2, and p3** columns have both uppercase and lowercase and some delimeters, hense, are inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. wrong datatype of **tweet_id**. should be string and not Integer as displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. columns such as **p1, p2, and p3** should be more discriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Tweet JSON data** \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  wrong datatype of **id**. should be string and not Integer as displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. irregular urls format in the **source** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness Issues \n",
    "\n",
    "**The twitter Archive WeRateDogs data table**\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo are slang names of dogs. This should be on a single column.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " **The Tweet JSON data** \n",
    " 1. Dropping unimportant columns\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. the **created_at** column should be renamed to **timestamp** to match up with the **The twitter Archive WeRateDogs data table** for consistency purpose.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. the **id** column should be remamed to **tweet_id** to match up with the **The twitter Archive WeRateDogs data table** and **The Image predictions data table**  for consistency and merging purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3: Cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the issues documented while assessing was cleaned and the following items were addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A copy of the original data was performed before the cleaning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The define-code-test framework was used and clearly documented`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data was performed and the result showed a high-quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Step 4: Storing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned data was stored in a master DataFrame in a CSV file named twitter_archive_master.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section at least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization was performed and clearly documented."
